Buy,"USD 1,275,000",2,2,Aruba authentic Cunucu house,"This house was built around 1900 and was left in ruins when the owner bought it.The new owner had promised the previous owner to restore it to its original shape and build, as much as possible, adding some modern features and making it a comfortable place to live in.This challenge took three years to accomplish in the way I thought the place deserved.All the walls were stripped of their outer layer of plaster, then reinforced with concrete beams and columns.The missing coral stones were hand-cut and replaced to match the existing ones.To add electric and plumbing to a house that wasn't built with that capacity, we had to dig trenches between the coral walls—a painstaking job that took months but yielded very satisfactory results.The LED light strips on the walls draw attention to the workmanship of the fishermen who built this house back when there were no power tools.The Kruispan-Dakpannen roof tiles were imported from Holland; there is only one manufacturer left in the world.The floor tiles were brought from abroad and beautifully dress the house.Both bathrooms were equipped with toilet bowls and sinks with a 1900s look. The sink bases are made of South American tree roots.To make the house more spacious, we built an outdoor kitchen with Italian windows and sliding doors that open to the front and back yards, allowing the breeze to blow through while you cook in this well-equipped kitchen with double ovens and all available features.The pool was a big innovation for Aruba.We brought the idea from Spain and built a sand pool with a beach entrance that integrates with the natural stone surround and lush green landscape.At sunset, the yard brightens up along with the surrounding wall lights, changing the scene to an amazing oasis of peace and comfort, with a surround Bose sound system.To finish, there is a terrace where you can watch the sunset.","May 21, 2025",Available,Aruba Sotheby’s International Realty,+297 5861010,0 m2 / 0 ft2,0 m2 / 0 ft2,https://arubalistings.com/sale/bakval/residential-13419-aruba-authentic-cunucu-house,12.509,70.009,https://arubalistings.com/storage/app/uploads/public/682/e1d/a0c/682e1da0c345c311431833.jpg

This breathtaking turnkey villa is not just a residence, it’s an experience, a sanctuary where elegance and privacy blend seamlessly into one unforgettable lifestyle. Welcome to the kind of Caribbean dream that doesn’t just exist in postcards, this is the real thing. From the moment the automatic gates glide open, you know you have arrived somewhere special. Towering palm trees whisper in the breeze, a peaceful Buddha statue greets you with calm energy, and a sense of serenity washes over you. Here, every moment feels effortless, timeless, and uniquely yours. Though the vibrant nightlife and famous beaches of Palm Beach are just minutes away, the tranquility of this hilltop hideaway makes you feel like the only person on the island. The View That Steals the Show Perched on an elevated plot, the villa offers sweeping panoramic views. By day, gaze out over the lush landscape and shimmering coastline. By night, the twinkling lights of Aruba’s luxury high-rise hotels glitter like distant stars. Beyond them, the vast Caribbean Sea stretches endlessly into the horizon, where coral reefs shimmer beneath the surface and private beaches await. It’s not just a view—it’s a living canvas that changes with the light. Smart Island Living, Reimagined This home is more than beautiful, it’s brilliantly thought out. Designed with sustainability and comfort in mind, the property is equipped with state-of-the-art eco-tech. Solar panels keep energy costs low. The lush tropical garden stays green and blooming thanks to smart irrigation and water reclamation systems, all remotely controlled. From lighting to security, everything is managed at the touch of a button, whether you're in Aruba or halfway around the globe. Even power outages are no match for the built-in generator, and for those days by the pool, automated floaters keep things perfect without lifting a finger. It's luxury with zero compromise. Spacious, Sophisticated and Full of Surprises Step inside the villa and discover 733 m2 of masterfully designed living space. Seven bedrooms. Six bathrooms. Three living rooms. A stunning mezzanine library. And a striking semi-circular pool that seems to melt into the house itself. One moment you're lounging on the terrace, and the next you’ve wandered into the open-concept living room through wide-folding doors. Inside feels like outside—and that’s exactly how it should be in paradise. Ceiling fans tucked artfully into the covered terrace offer both a breeze and warm ambiance after sunset. And as the vaulted ceiling rises above the terrace, it draws your eye to the mezzanine level, a private, light-filled workspace with French doors leading out to another intimate terrace. Below the mezzanine, the layout flows with effortless charm. Bedrooms, each with private bathrooms, are nestled near a country-style kitchen that invites slow mornings and long family meals. Room for Everyone, Room for Possibility Ideal for hosting guests or generating rental income, the villa includes a fully independent apartment on the lower level, featuring two spacious bedrooms and its own kitchen. It’s perfect for visiting family, friends, or short-term vacation rentals. But that’s not all. A separate guest house adds even more versatility, a complete residence in itself, with dazzling views and open-plan living designed to capture the same luxurious feel as the main house. And when it's time to explore or entertain, a ground-floor garage accommodates up to four vehicles. The Art of Outdoor Living Designed by a Dutch landscape architect who fell in love with Aruba, the garden is a living masterpiece. It’s arguably one of the most enchanting private gardens on the island. Mature palms, native flora, and immaculate green grass set the stage for outdoor living at its best. Enjoy evenings at the large outdoor bar by the pool, or unwind beside the tranquil pond and cascading waterfall. Thanks to the villa’s orientation, you will always find just the right mix of sun and shade, cooled naturally by Aruba’s constant trade winds. Everything Refreshed, Everything Ready Recently renovated with refined Dutch design touches, the villa’s brand new interiors are fresh, stylish and ready to move in. The spacious Hyundai Palisade in the garage comes with the villa, a convenient bonus for everyday use and perfect for exploring the island with family or guests in comfort and style.
